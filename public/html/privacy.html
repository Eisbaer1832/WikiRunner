    <h2>Which data is stored locally?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>Game History (if enabled)</li>
        <li>Preferences like the selected Wikirunner Server instance</li>

    </ul> 
    
    <h2>Why is this data stored?</h2>
    <p>Storing your preferences enables you to have a persistent app experience, even across device reboots. Nobody likes having to type in their password every time they open an app.</p>

    <h2>Which data is collected externally?</h2>
    <p> Our servers don't store any data permanently. Usernames are only stored for the runtime of the game. </p>
    <p> Additional data collection may occur through the ingame Wikipedia webview. We are not associated with the Wikimedia Foundation and therefore can not disclose which data is collected by them. </p>

    <h2>Which permissions are used?</h2>
    <p>Wikirunner uses the network permission in order to establish a connection with the game server, as well as Wikipedia</p>
